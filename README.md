## Project Details (Project Overview Below)

This engineering effort invites you to implement and use a program called
`objectprocessor` that searches a large data structure for objects that have
certain patterns.
The `objectprocessor` works by reading in a text file in a comma-separate
value (CSV) format that contains raw data about a person on each row of the
file. Next, the program converts each row of data into an instance of the
`Person` class, stores that instance inside of a `List`, and then performs one
of several configurable searches for instances of `Person` that match the
constraints specified on the command-line of the `objectprocessor`. Finally, the
program will save all of the matching rows of data in a specified file. In
addition to implementing the functions that perform the file input and output
and the searching for matching `Person`s in the `List`, you will use a
comprehensive command-line interface, implemented with
[Typer](https://typer.tiangolo.com/), that allows you to easily confirm the
files for input and output and the terms for the query for matching people.

### Raw Data

The raw data in the input file correspond to information about fake people,
organized in the following fashion.

``` text
Cindy Burns,Dominican Republic,(102)481-3875,"Pharmacist, hospital",rtorres@example.org
Jason Bailey,Falkland Islands (Malvinas),+1-552-912-2326,Leisure centre manager,daniel51@example.com
Andrew Johnson,Portugal,733-554-3949,"Engineer, site",michael94@example.com
Carol Poole,Isle of Man,365.529.7270,Pensions consultant,piercebrenda@example.com
Riley Gonzalez,Libyan Arab Jamahiriya,7752827092,Materials engineer,osborneeric@example.net
```

It is worth noting that all of the data in the input file is automatically
generated by a tool that uses the [Faker](https://github.com/joke2k/faker)
library and is thus synthetic in nature.

### Expected Output

After you finish a correct implementation of all the `objectprocessor`'s
features you can run it with the command `poetry run objectprocessor
--search-term tylera --attribute email --input-file input/people.txt
--output-file output/people.txt` and see that it produces output like the
following.

``` cmd
ðŸ§® Reading in the data from the specified file input/people.txt

ðŸš€ Parsing the data file and transforming it into people objects

ðŸ•µ  Searching for the people with an email that matches the search term
'tylera'

âœ¨ Here are the matching people:

- Debra Williams is a Retail merchandiser who lives in Guadeloupe. You can
call this person at 407-035-6634 and email them at tyleranderson@example.com
- Christopher Lin is a Embryologist, clinical who lives in United Kingdom.
You can call this person at (515)580-8082x35082 and email them at
tyleranthony@example.com
- William Valdez is a Air broker who lives in Algeria. You can call this
person at 408.592.1306 and email them at tylerashley@example.net
- Joshua Chaney is a Water engineer who lives in San Marino. You can call
this person at 310.624.7694x64127 and email them at tylerallen@example.net

âœ¨ Saving the matching people to the file output/people.txt
```

It is important to note that since `objectprocessor` is deterministic and
not dependent on the performance characteristics of your computer, your
implementation of the program should produce exactly the above output. The
above invocation of the program looks for people with records that have an
email address containing the search term `tylera`. After inputting the 50,000
records from the file called `input/people.txt` and converting each one to an
object-oriented format, the program searches and ultimately determines that
there are four people in the input file that match the search parameters.

Finally, don't forget that you can display `objectprocessor`'s help menu and
learn more about its features by typing `poetry run objectprocessor --help` to
show the following output. It is worth noting that all of the parameters to the
`objectprocessor` program, excepting those connected to completion of
command-line arguments or the help menu, are required. This means that the
`objectprocessor` will produce an error if you do not specify the four required
parameters respectively related to the search term, the "attribute" of a person
stored in a row of data (e.g., the email address or the country), and both the
input file and the output file that will save the search results.

```text
 Usage: objectprocessor [OPTIONS]

 Input data about a person and then analyze and save it.

```

Please note that the provided source code does not contain all of the
functionality to produce the output displayed in this section. As the next
section explains, you should add the features needed to ensure that
`objectprocessor` produces the expected output! Although you don't need to add
any functionality to the `person` module, you will need to address all of the
`TODO` markers in the `process` and `main` modules.

### Adding Functionality

If you study the file `objectprocessor/objectprocessor/process.py` you will see
that it has many `TODO` markers that designate the sorting algorithms that you
must implement so as to ensure that `objectprocessor` will produce correct
output. For instance, you will need to implement most of the steps in the `def
extract_person_data(data: str) -> List[person.Person]` function that takes as
input all of the text in the input CSV file and produces as output a `List` of
instances of the `Person` class in the `person` module. You will also need to
implement the functions that determine if a specific instance of `Person`
matches the criteria specified on the program's command-line interface and those
that perform the file input and output. Finally, you are invited to implement
the functions in the `main` module that call the functions in `process`.

Once you complete a task associated with a `TODO` marker, make sure that you
delete it and revise the prompt associated with the marker into a meaningful
comment! After you revise all of the `TODO` markers your project should feature
polished source code that is ready for contribution to an open-source project or
described on your professional web site. Finally, you will notice that this
project does not come with test cases. If you want to both establish a
confidence in the correctness of and find defects in your program, then you will
need to design, implement, and run your own tests using
[Pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/)!

### Running Checks

If you study the source code in the `pyproject.toml` file you will see that it
includes the following section that specifies different executable tasks like
`ruff`. If you are in the `palindromechecker` directory that contains the
`pyproject.toml` file and the `poetry.lock` file, the tasks in this section
make it easy to run commands like `poetry run task ruff` to automatically run
the ruff linter designed to check the Python source code in your program and
its test suite to confirm that your source code adheres to the industry-standard.
You can also use the command `poetry run task fix` to automatically reformat the
source code. `poetry run task ruffdetails` will print out detailed linting errors
that point to exactly what ruff views as a linting error. Make sure to examine
the `pyproject.toml` file for other convenient tasks that you can use to both
check and improve your project!

Along with running tasks like `poetry run task ruff`, you can run the command
`gatorgrade --config config/gatorgrade.yml` to check your work. If your work
meets the baseline requirements and adheres to the best practices that proactive
programmers adopt you will see that all the checks pass when you run
`gatorgrade`. You can study the `config/gatorgrade.yml` file in your repository
to learn how the :material-github:
[GatorGrade](https://github.com/GatorEducator/gatorgrade) program runs
:material-github: [GatorGrader](https://github.com/GatorEducator/gatorgrader)
to automatically check your program and technical writing.

### Project Reflection

Once you have finished both of the previous technical tasks, you can use a text
editor to answer all of the questions in the `writing/reflection.md` file. For
instance, you should provide the output of the Python program in several fenced
code blocks, explain the meaning of the Python source code segments that you
implemented, and answer all of the other questions about your experiences in
completing this project. A specific goal for this project's reflection is to
ensure that you can explain Python source code written in an object-oriented
fashion and discuss the trade-offs associated with this approach. For instance,
you should understand how the following constructor, implemented in the
`__init__` method, is used to create a new instance of the `Person` class.

```python
def __init__(
    self, name: str, country: str, phone_number: str, job: str, email: str
) -> None:
    """Define the constructor for a person."""
    self.name = name
    self.country = country
    self.phone_number = phone_number
    self.job = job
    self.email = email
```

### Project Assessment

Since this project is an engineering effort, it is aligned with the
**evaluating** and **creating** levels of [Bloom's
taxonomy](/proactive-learning/blooms-taxonomy/). You can learn more about how a
proactive programming expert will assess your work by examining the [assessment
strategy](/proactive-learning/assessment-strategy/). From the start to the end
of this project you may make an unlimited number of reattempts at submitting
source code and technical writing that meet all aspects of the project's
specification.
